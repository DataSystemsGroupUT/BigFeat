# What is BigFeat?
BigFeat is a scalable and interpretable automated feature engineering framework that optimizes for improving the quality of input features with the aim to maximize the predictive performance according to a user-defined metric.
BigFeat employs a dynamic feature generation and selection mechanism that constructs a set of expressive features that improve the prediction performance while retaining interpretability.


# input/output:
Bigfeat takes the original input features and returns a collection of base and engineered features expected to improve the predictive performance.

# Installation:
  - **pip** : pip install bigfeat
  - **local installation**: python setup.py

# Requirement:
  - 'pandas',
  - 'numpy',
  - 'scikit-learn',
  - 'lightgbm'
  
  ## Paper is under submission to EDBT research conference.
